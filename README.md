# Sahaj-task
Order management task

I used sqlite3 as it is included with Python so no sql setup or server is required
the start_again file is intended to remove the data to re-start testing if required

after running start_again you call set_up database and you will now have a set of tables for use
valid products added :('eggs'), ('apples'), ('coffee'), ('cake') ,
('bread') ,('milk'), ('newspaper'), ('book'),('cat food')

Apologies for the capital s in Showorder - used to make it stand out
